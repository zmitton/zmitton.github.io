			<p>  Hi, my name is Zac Mitton and you have reached my webpage hosted on GitHub. My hobbies include Ceramics, and playing Ultimate (frisbee). Right now I am in the midst of a major life change. I just moved to lincoln park, and am beging at Dev Bootcamp in May (officially). Dev Bootcamp is like a very intense accelerated software development course aimed at preparing students to enter the tech industry. It's nine weeks long and occupies student's entire life durring that time. Im doing it because I want a better career and software/technology interest me more than anything. I like to build things, and I like new technologies, which is also why I'm a member of the local Chicago Hackerspace, PS1. </p>
