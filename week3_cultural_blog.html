			<h2>Pairing Sessions:</h2>
			<p> So far in the first three weeks I've have done 2 guided pairing sessions and 2 regular ones. Its been an interesting and new expeirience for me. The first guided pairing session came at a good time durring the second week. I was starting to feel a little disconected from everyone, having never physically been in the smae room with any of them I was getting what can only be called technology overload. with all the new ways of communicating I was feeling lost. I missed the days when you could just physically meet with someone and they could help you with something; And I know pairing sessions use google hangout, which is technology as well, but at least you are "virtually" in a room with the person. Once the sessions begins, you are pretty much in the room with the person. I guess thats the best I can hope for fer now. </p>		
			<h3>Guided Pairing:</h3>
			<p>	The first session was a guided one. I couldn't have been happier with the outcome. My partner was 2 things:</br></br> Easy to work with</br>Knowledgable on the material.</br></br> Thats basically what you want. To be completely frank, and selfish: You want someone smarter than you on the other side. Thats the way you're gonna learn the most. All that aside, I did the best I could to keep up and contribute myself, And I think we played to each others strengths and weaknesses quite nicely. I informed him that css was not my dtrong suit beforehand, so we decided to have him drive on that part. I was able to drive durring the html part of the challenge, and we split the job down the middle. At the end we talked more about our personal lives and where we were each at. He was interested in working together again, so now I've got a cohort in the group that can help me out if I need it, and is willing to work in pairs going forward. The next guided session was similar. This time it was javascript that we were learning so I had a bit of lead on the other person. I probably taught the other person some stuff that time, and again, we discussed working together again because it went well.
			</p>			
			<h3>Pair-programming:</h3>
			<p>	Since the guided session I've arranged a few pairing sessions on my own. Most were with the same people I'd already met, and went just as smoothly as before. 1 however was with a new person and it went a bit awry. The problem was that neither of us really knew how to solve the problem. We started doing research durring the session, and it got rather quiet for a while. I',m sot sure what the best strategy is on that. I like to code little practice bits a piece at a time and view the output when testing new things I've never done before when coding. I didn't want to mess up our Stype but I dont really know how to do that kind of stuff as a pair. Maybe I will get better at it in time. We didn't end up finishing after an hour and we both had to go...

			<h2>Feedback</h2>
			<p> The feedback system we've mainly been using is a custom piece of software on Socrates where the feedback must be rated, before it can be administered. I'm not sure I've seen any of the benefits of that system yet because I've rated every piece I've seen as "kind". we don't know each other well enough yet to give each other really tough criticism. Maybe once we are all in a room together for 16 hours a day, we will start to give more passionate feedback.</br>/<br>Either way I'm not saying that I don't like the system of feedback. I think its a cool idea, and it remains to be seen how it will go later on.</p>
