			<h2>Functional vs. Imperative Programming</h2>
			<p>
			One of the newest programming paradigms to be talked about is "functional programming". Depending on how strict you want to get with it, its a style that uses no variables, and no "states". It achieves tasks using only functions. Because functions only depend on input and output, and functional languages don't have states, the behavior of a program can be much more predictable. With other styles of programming, it can be virtually imposible to test every possible situation for unusual behavior. There are some languages that allow for this style, they must have "first class" functions. This means that functions can be passed as arguments just the way that variables usually are. Javascript and Ruby are two languages that do this. Languages Like "C" do not. Other languages are strictly functional. These languages dont even allow for conventional variables. One very popular strictly functional language is called Haskell. Many believe this style of programming may be the future of large software projects.</p>
			<h3>Uses</h3>			
			<p>Strictly functional languages right now are very talked about in academia, but are seldom used in business applications. I believe this is because they are harder to understand. I have read a lot about them and still don't really understood how to get around using variables. On the other hand. Languages with blocks and lambdas can use functional techniques when appropriate. Many of these languages are very popular and widely used.</p>
			<h3>Outlook</h3>			
			<p>Although they have many advantages, the fact of the matter is, the world will not begin to use strictly functional languages anytime soon. For the most part, companies don't have the budget to redo all of there code. Even new systems will most likely use a mix of both functional and imperative styles, because many of the differences with are both advantages and disadvantages. Sometimes functional implementations are more efficient; Sometimes less. Sometimes they are easier to code; Other times harder. Sometimes they are easier to read; Other times much more difficult. Whether or not a company decides to implement functional languages in the future depends on a number of things including how well the concepts happen to lend themselves to the specific application. Some uses of functional concepts are more straightforward, while others are not. One thing is for sure: There will be some transitioning in the near future toward many of these useful techniques</p>
