		<h2>Favorite Sites</h2>
		<div id="blog1">
			<h3>eBay</h3> <p> This has always been one of my favorite sites, its simple to understand and its always really easy to use. When you load the page, it forms perfectly to your current screen size no matter how big that may be. Right in fron, are tons of items I've viewed, or purchased in the past. You can continue to scroll down infinitely to see more and more of these elated items. This can seem a bit cluttered, but they are wnly pictures of other products, so the extra content does not add any confusion. As soon as you type in the name of what you are looking for, ebay switches to  search page, that has common items toward the top, and filters on the side for narrowing down the search. This really is where the page shines, because the internet is a huge place, and the functionality of being able to narrow down what you want in an affective way makes all the difference. The more time I spend on this site, the deeper I get into looking at products, and "chaining through links", from one to the next. I've bought tons of items on ebay, as well as sold some myself. Both actions support the company.

			<h3>Wordpress</h3><p> This is a simple site, but I feel like the designers just have a really good eye when it comes to delivering content in an elegant way. The text is usually a bit bigger, and the fonts seem clean and new. The colors draw your eye in and make you think the site is a breeze to use. The site also has excellent fluid responsiveness. The homepage is basic, and minimal, with several break points, and no confusion as to your choices of what to do. I havent exactly "bought " anything from Wordpress, but I did use there website software to create a website once, and I ended up paying a sister company $80 for a template.
			</p>
					
			<p><h3>Amazon</h3> Amazon Is another website that has been around for a long time, and has updated its layout with the changing times of the internet. The attention on the page is drawn to the kindle and other items they are pushing, as well as a list of books that are chosen based on my user data. I've always found it easy to use, and I always feel like I'm able to find the best price on a particular book. This has to do with the way searches are done, laid out and organized, as well as the particular options you are given, and the way they store the books in their database. I've bought lots of books on this site, and sold some of my old textbooks as well. I'm the type of person that likes to read weird and rare books and before amazon, there was really no way to do that. Now there is a phenomenal way, and I can even buy used for cheaper than a bookstore.
