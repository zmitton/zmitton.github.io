			<h2>Problems Facing the tech industry</h2>
			<p>Every time something new is invented, an older thing becomes obsolete. This can scare some people, and even convince them that the innovative new thing is the causing harm and must be stopped. This kind of thinking is routed in fallacies, but nevertheless it can steer government policies, shut down companies, and affect public opinions.
			</p>
			<p>Lets rewind a few years to when the economy really took a dive around 2009. The stock market was volatile, people were lossing jobs, and companies were going broke. People trying to grasp the issues found had different opinions on who and what was to blame. Some said it was greed, not much you can do about that; Others said it was corruption, which doesn't get you very far without proof; But one source that always becomes an easy target, is inovation, technology, and just downright new shit that people dont understand. 
			</p>
			<h4>First up were fancy new mortgage practices.</h3>
			<p>A somewhat more recent activity has been the re-selling and re-selling of mortgages, that get grouped, and divided up, and "hedged" with other assets before they were sold in some completely different form way down the line. People hadn't heard of this until now. It seemed complicated. Complicated things are black magic.
			</p>
			<h4>Next was "micro-trades"</h4>
			<p>It's difficult for some people to understand how stocks work, or why this would add value to society, but they basically "naturally fund things that are working". thats the main idea, It's not always true, but overall it has to be. People intimately involved in this trade, will notice patterns: The price of seasonal commodities dropping in certain months etc. Some patterns are more subtle than others, but every stock broker is looking for them, and doing what they can to make money off this by buying low and selling high. This "greed" has a beneficial price stabilizing effect because selling something will lower the price... So selling high will steady it. Intelligent people have used computers to help them calculate these trends that they have found, and since the trades themselves are happening onlint now, the entire process (decision to sale) can happen within the computers. this has sparked more and more high speed "micro-trades" where these computers buy and sell many times a minute based on reasons unknown by outsiders. The finger was pointed at them, and some serious talk ensued about making the practice illegal. The boundaries of legality would have been impossible to define (can a person still use a calculator before deciding?), and luckily they didn't.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Here, There, Everywhere</h4>
			<p>The airline industry blamed new deal sites. Small businesses blamed large ones, and newspapers and books blamed Amazon. The list goes on and on. new innovation comes in, status quo gets shaken up. The question is simply, whether we want to live in a world that's improving, or if we would like to "look in" our current quality of life. Because we can keep things the same. If we are willing to keep paying high prices for things, that never improve, we can, and thats what some people are fighting for. As people began to panic, they called for the government, the one entity with the power to basically do whatever they want, to get involved. There are of course, other powerful entities, that can affect change be it good or bad, but what sets the government appart as the biggest threat to inovation: The government is the only entity that can use force. I dont even mean physical necessarily. Other opinions can only choose not to support something, the government can shut you down. 
			</p>
			<h4>These people are right</h4>
			<p>The problem is, that these people are right. New tech <em>does</em> encroach on current businesses. Thats because jobs only exist, where work is on the fringe between being trainable for a person to do, but not easy enough to find a way to eliminate it. </p>
			<h4>Do we have a solution?</h4>
			<p>So you're convinced. All you're jobs are going away. They are only here now for a short period, and they will be gone before you know it. What the hell are we going to do when there are non left?
			</p>
			<h4>Party into the Future</h4>
			<p>The thing about change, is that once you get past the fear, and really accept it, you realize that the other side is better than where you started. Even though jobs are becoming obsolete, new jobs- better ones, are being created all the time. To prove this point, all you have to do is realize that, technology is not a new thing. In the 50's there used to be a job called a "computer" (no seriously). That was a person who was good at math, that sat down all day and calculated things that required lots and lots of mathematical computation. Someone used to have to do that. not just anyone, a smart person, who probably got paid pretty good. I'm glad to live in a world where I can get a job creating software and leave the long division behind. And it's not just since the 50's, this has been happening for literally thousands of years. Before the industrial revolution, 90% of people had to be farmers. 80% of them had to lose there job at some point. When work is eliminated, the world becomes richer, and everyone wins, even if a few people have a tough couple months movin' on.
