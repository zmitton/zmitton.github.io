			<h2>Dealing with Conflict</h2>
			<h3>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h3>
			<p>I had a roommate who has been struggling with alcoholism. He has had a problem for years, but recently it really got out of control. I struggled with confronting him, and knowing what to do to help him stop. </p>
			<h3>What was the source of the conflict?</h3>
			<p>I cared about him, and the more I did to try to help him, the more angry he got at me. He would drink secretively, and when I was supposed to make sure he was sobering up, he kept wanting to leave the apartment by himself. He had many excuses as to why, and as soon as I solved them, he would manufacture another reason why a couldn't go with him.</p>
			<h3>How did you handle that conflict?</h3>
			<p> Eventually My friends and I realized he couldn't stop on his own. We got his parents envolved and they were able to get him to stop, although, is is still a struggle for him in general.</p>
			<h3>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h3>
			<p>Getting his parents involved definitely helped but I'm not sure anything else I did helped at all. The more intoxicated he was, the more difficult it became to appeal to him with logic.</p>
			<h3>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h3>
			<p>I would probably have called his parents or sponsor sooner if i had the chance again. Although we did call pretty quick (after about 1-2 weeks). I'll admit that nothing I did helped, so I would be open to trying other things.</p>
			<h3>What did you learn from this experience?</h3>
			<p>I learned that when you want to solve a problem that directly involves another person, you cant do it unless the other person has an interest in helping themselves. People can say that dealing with an intoxicated person isn't the same as a normal conflict, because they aren't mentally all there, but the real reason people do the things they do, is based more on emotions than anything. Emotions are actually based on real needs in a survival sense, so they can't (and shouldn't) be eliminated simply through a mental exercise. I usually try to understand why the emotion exists, and think about what actions to take to improve the area thats lacking. </p>
