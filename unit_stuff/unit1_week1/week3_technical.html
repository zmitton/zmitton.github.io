			<h2>Looping In Ruby</h2>
			<p>Loops have always been one of the most important ideas that a computer can do. Loops, along with Sequences, and decisions make up the 3 structures that can create all programming logic. Having learned C++ first, the "while loop" was always the simplest. It's the easiest to understand: The block repeats <em>while</em> a condition is true. usually inside the loop a counter variable is incremented eventually stopping the code. Once you begin solving actual problems, it quickly becomes apparent that this "counter" variable come up over and over, which is when you learn the "for loop" basically the same as the while loop, except you define a temporary counter variable, and how to increment it concisely at the top. This makes the code faster and more readable.</br></br> With Ruby there seems to be a much different approach not just to looping, but to the language as a whole. There is an attitude toward simplifying and condensing code. This direction is emphasized by the number of different looping methods. Some of the ones that I have already been taught as a beginner are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>while</li>
				<li>for</li>
				<li>each</li>
				<li>each_with_index</li>
				<li>map</li>
				<li>collect</li>
				<li>inject</li>
				<li>sort_by</li>
				<li>delete_if</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This list can go on forever, and the documentation I have seen seems to have at least 30-40 methods like this.</br></br> The truth is, I'm not sure how I feel about this yet, because, although they can make your code more concise, they also cause the programmer to have to know what they do when they read them. It's nice to focus more on logic than syntax all of the time, but I'm already starting to see the over benefits of the more code.  </p>

<!--
Research one of the following questions/topics. In your blog post, you will want to explain the background and teach others how to implement what you've learned.

Arrays vs. Hashes. What are they? What are they good for? How do you know which one to use? (Teach others a strategy for deciding)
Looping - Discuss the various ways to loop in Ruby. How can you decide which is best to use? (Teach others a strategy for deciding)
Ruby vs. JavaScript - Discuss the benefits/drawbacks of each as you've experienced them. Explain to others how to decide which is better to use for what. Also include examples of how to do the same thing in each.
If you want to go more in-depth with any of these research memory use and link it to your strategy for deciding which to use.

Write this blog for an audience of newb programmers.
