			<h3>The last time somebody asked my for advise</h3> 
			<p>The last time I can remember that somebody asked for my for advise, it was about talking to girls. I don't really know why he thought I would be able to help with that, I hardly knew the guy. He works at the community kitchen I volunteer at. I'm actually not much of a conversationalist myself but I obliged. I pretty much told him what I do when trying to converse with anyone I dont know very well: Ask questions. People like to talk about themselves. Also it takes the pressure off of you. Its much easier to be a good listener then to have to constantly think of something smart to say. I used to try to just act really cool, and say only witty things. The problem with that is: Its hard to constantly come up with awesomely smart things to say, and even if you do, it doesn't lend itself well to a two sided conversation. And when you ask questions, you can get to know the other person better. They might even be interesting!
