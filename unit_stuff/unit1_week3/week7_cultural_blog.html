			<h2>Applying Social Science</h2>
			<h3>The Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<p> A few weeks ago I wrote a blog entry detailing some of the values that I believe are at my core. Last week in class we learned about a phenomenon known as the stereotype threat. Now I'd like to take a look at ways to put the knowledge to use. The following are what I consider my strong suit: </p>
			<h3>My Core Values</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Truth</li>
				<li>Integrity</li>
				<li>Responsibility</li>
				<li>Freedom</li>
				<li>Environmentalism</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			<h4>Freedom:</h4> This can mean a lot of things, And I tend to use the liberal definition of it. I believe a person is free to do as they please, so long as it doesn't directly infringe on another person's freedoms. This means, that you are free to overcome, and free to move up in this world no matter where you are from. </br></br>  
			<h4>Integrity:</h4> This to me is all about being a good person on a consistent bases, independent of where or when, or who might be watching. Doing this makes a person feel good about their life. I think I'm a good person, because I good things for others when I can. Believing in myself should affect my own performance in a stressful situation where I might be tempted to give up.</br></br>
			<h4>Responsibility:</h4> I believe in evolution. I also believe that fun and happiness are feelings cause by evolution. When something "feels good" its probably because its affecting our evolution goals positively. Luckily this is a rewarding world view because evolution is a net positive game. It can be at least. The goal is the advancement and reproduction of oneself and the human race. Everyone can win together, and become happy. We do live here on a finite earth right now, and thats where the <b>environmentalism</b> comes in. But as Hans Rosling's research has shown, areas with high quality of life have family planing, and therefore actually have significantly smaller family sizes and slower population growth. I believe curbing overpopulation is an important part of protecting our planet for the foreseeable future.</br></br>
			<h4>Truth:</h4> Most of all I believe in truth. This is the most important of the virtues, because it means I believe in what's real. Like the stereotype threat. Simply knowing about the stereotype threat, and understanding it is by far the most awesomely effective way to overcome it. The fact is any that race or group is virtually as capable at a task as any other. Once you accept that, you should be able to avoid falling victim to it at least when its obvious.
