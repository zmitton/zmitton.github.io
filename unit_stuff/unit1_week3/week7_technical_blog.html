			<h2>Databases</h2>
			<h3>SQL Injection</h3>
			<p> SQL injection is a problem that exist when user input is being mixed with a database statement. This situation as a whole is basically unavoidable; Data from users will always have a roll in the queries made by a backend server. </br></br>For example, lets say I have a website with user accounts. I inevitably will have a box for someone to give me their username. Then I would most certainly take that input and use it to pull up their account. Here is some ruby that could potentially create an SQL query statement:</br></br></p>
			<div class="code-block">
				<p>
				<data-comment># input_from_user = "cool_user_1"</data-comment><br>
				sql_text = "select * from users where username like '#{input_from_user}';"</br>
				<data-comment># sql_text = "select * from users where username like 'cool_user_1';"</data-comment><br>
				
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
			Assuming the users username is "cool_user_1", and they type the into the box, the variable <data-code>sql_text</data-code> will be straightforward, the program will work as expected, and the account will be returned.</br></br>
			
			However, if the user wants to break into the system they could wright something like this into the input box: <data-code>%; --</data-code> then the <data-code>sql_text</data-code> variable would become: </br></br><data-code>select * from users where username like '%; --';</data-code></br></br> the sql symbol <data-code> -- </data-code> is a comment, so everything after it means nothing. Also the symbol <data-code> % </data-code> is a "wildcard" operator. It matches with anything. Affectively this statement will return every user account. The hacker has "broken in" to the database using SQL injection.  </br></br> I assume most actual implementations are a bit more complex and clever, but the principle is essentially the same.
		
			
			
			<h4>Parameterized queries</h4>
			There are a few ways to avoid this, but the best by far is by implementing parameterized queries. I am under the opinion that adding, fixes, and aversions sprinkled in here and there is a crap way to look at security. Some people will fully working systems may use these techniques in order to save money, but making all the queries parameterized virtually eliminates the risk of sequel injection. </br></br> Parameterized queries are a special way of making a query where you keep the statement and the input separated. Here is an example of the same situation using this technique:
			<div class="code-block">
				<p>
				<data-comment># input_from_user = "cool_user_1"</data-comment><br>
				sql_text = "select * from users where username like :input_from_user;"</br>
				sql_method(sql_text, input_from_user)<br>
				</p>
			</div>
			Now the example above is more like "suedocode", but the basic idea is that the user input and the rest of the statement is kept separate, and the database query uses a method that knows this. The method knows that the second argument is only to be interpreted as a matching pattern, and not as a command.</br></br> All the programmer  needs to worry about is sending the command off in this way, and the rest is done behind the scenes. 
			</p>
			
			<h4>NoSQL</h4>
			<p>
			More descriptively non-relational databases is a term given to data storage systems that don't follow the standard convention of having entries with fields and tables. Obviously It is possible to store data in another way, and any other way can be dubbed "NoSQL". The purpose of doing such a thing, usually is for performance optimization. This can be optimal when small performance gains are desired, over readability and ease of use. Usually big companies with huge server warehouses are concerned with these performance increases. After all they are paying for servers in terms of electricity. For small applications, the more organized, and easier to understand SQL relational databases are sufficient. </br></br> Regardless, the other classifications may include: </br>
			Keyâ€“value Stores</br>
			Column Store</br>
			Document Store</br>
			Graph Database</br></br>
			</p>
			
			<h4>General Optimization</h4>
			<p>
			Other ways to optimize a database include making normalizing and indexing:</br>
			</p>
			
			<h4>Normalization</h4>
			<p>
			Normalizing a database is basically all about not repeating data. This does two things: It help keep the database smaller, and it prevents against data conflicts. The practice of doing this involves a lot of linking. If a customer has an address, and they create an order. The order entry saved should include  a field for address_id, not the whole address just copied into this other table. You already have that data, so you should just link to it. Later when you need to pull up data that is normalized, it may take a lot of "join" commands. This is a drawback, but generally is considered worth it. Data conflicts can arise when you store the same data in two different places. Lets say eventually, somewhere in your app you add a feature to  change the address.  Its extremely difficult to remember that the address has now been stored in an address table entry, and in every order entry by that customer. when you don't save redundant information in your database, this is imposible to happen.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Indexing</h4>
			<p>
			When you create a field in an SQL database you can choose at any time for it to be an "index". Basically this makes it faster to search though when you are looking up entries using <data-code>WHEN that_field = "some_keyword"</data-code>. What the database does, is create a hash-table for that field. The database can find the entry using binary sort methods that are much faster than the usual method of looking through the database one entry at a time from start to finish. This can also have a negative affect if you are inserting entries into the database more often then searching. Every time you insert a new entry into the table, the hash-table has to be re-organized. Generally something like "user_id" should probably be an index because it is used to relate everything back to a user.
