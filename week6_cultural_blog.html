			<h2>The Stereotype Threat</h2>
			<p> Claude M. Steele is a Social Psychologist who has spent most of his career researching and experimenting with a phenomenon he calls the stereotype threat. He tries to understand social interactions in everyday life. He started his research wondering why ethnicities, and groups with negative academic stereotypes seem to actually underperform in schools. His goals include finding ways to integrate races more harmoniously in ways that everyone can flourish independent of race and negative stereotypes.</p>
			<h3>Background: What is it?</h3>
			<p> The stereotype threat is a phenomenon where stereotypes, especially negative ones, actually affect cognitive outcomes. Countless controlled experiments have confirmed this. Basically, if you remind someone of the negative stereotype before taking a test, they will perform significantly worse ( 0.6 standard deviations was a notable amplitude of this affect). The experiments themselves were quite convincing. Mixing around opposing stereotypes for asian women for instance, you can cause them to perform better or worse on a math test, depending on the stereotype you focus on. This work seems to prove its own significance. Obviously when someones identity affects their work, it becomes an important thing to consider. </p>
			<p>Steele suggested the reasons for people underperforming under the weight of a negative a stereotype may go like this: When the student gets to a tough  question, they begin fall back on the stereotype. As much as they want to disprove it, they become frustrated, and their mind begins to race. There is physical evidence documenting the persons nervous system becoming heightened as well.</p>
			<h3>My Experience with The Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<p>We all have personal identities, and the ones that affect us the most, are the ones that are brought to our attention most often in social situations. For instance I'm Italian. I'm proud of that, and I identify myself as such, but you can't tell by looking at me, and it doesn't really come up much. For me, this identity isn't affecting me too much in the ways relevant to this work. I also have never really heard of many limiting stereotypes attached to being Italian.</p>
			<p>Steele has done experiments where he told a white student he/she was going to have an open discussion about affirmative action. He showed the person pictures of who they would be talking to. In some cases the pictures were of black people, and in others, they were white people. The idea of having a conversation about race with black people, scared them. They would arrange the chairs in the room much further appart.  This is one thing I can relate to. Nobody wants to be perceived as racist, myself being a white male that considers himself not to be racist, can relate to their nervousness. A white male might have a "lot to lose" in that situation. It could affect my life negatively to be perceived as a racist, and therefore I sometimes try to avoid that type of confrontation altogether. </p>			
			<h3>My Plan: How to Break the Cycle</h3>
			<p>Recognizing these stereotypes and realizing they are only as true as you believe they are, can help immensely. Looking past them and working together can have a positive affect as well. Steele talked about his own experience in grad school with an advisor that took him under his wing, and treated him like anybody else. He believes that relationship had a huge positive impact on him. Race was an identity that did not affect their relationship, and the mentor confirmed regularly simply through his actions, that Steele had as much to contribute as anyone else. </p>
			<p>Steele discussed an experiment on how to give good feedback as well. In situation where race barriers exist is is especially difficult to have well accepted feedback. The results of some of his feedback studies were very surprising as well. The best way to give feedback, according to his research, may have little to do with stereotypes or race. Letting the person know that you believe in their ability to do this particular type of work is the most productive way to give feedback. Telling them you think the world of them "in general" did not help at all, in Steele's studies.
