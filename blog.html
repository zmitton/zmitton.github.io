			<h2>Databases <data-date>April 24th, 2014</data-date></h2>
			<h3>SQL Injection</h3>
			<p> SQL injection is a problem that exist when user input is being mixed with a database statement. This situation as a whole is basically unavoidable; Data from users will always have a roll in the queries made by a backend server. </br></br>For example, lets say I have a website with user accounts. I inevitably will have a box for someone to give me their username. Then I would most certainly take that input and use it to pull up their account. Here is some ruby that could potentially create an SQL query statement:</br></br></p>
			<div class="code-block">
				<p>
				<data-comment># input_from_user = "cool_user_1"</data-comment><br>
				sql_text = "select * from users where username like '#{input_from_user}';"</br>
				<data-comment># sql_text = "select * from users where username like 'cool_user_1';"</data-comment><br>
				
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
			Assuming the users username is "cool_user_1", and they type the into the box, the variable <data-code>sql_text</data-code> will be straightforward, the program will work as expected, and the account will be returned.</br></br>
			
			However, if the user wants to break into the system they could wright something like this into the input box: <data-code>%; --</data-code> then the <data-code>sql_text</data-code> variable would become: </br></br><data-code>select * from users where username like '%; --';</data-code></br></br> the sql symbol <data-code> -- </data-code> is a comment, so everything after it means nothing. Also the symbol <data-code> % </data-code> is a "wildcard" operator. It matches with anything. Affectively this statement will return every user account. The hacker has "broken in" to the database using SQL injection.  </br></br> I assume most actual implementations are a bit more complex and clever, but the principle is essentially the same.
		
			
			
			<h4>Parameterized queries</h4>
			There are a few ways to avoid this, but the best by far is by implementing parameterized queries. I am under the opinion that adding, fixes, and aversions sprinkled in here and there is a crap way to look at security. Some people will fully working systems may use these techniques in order to save money, but making all the queries parameterized virtually eliminates the risk of sequel injection. </br></br> Parameterized queries are a special way of making a query where you keep the statement and the input separated. Here is an example of the same situation using this technique:
			<div class="code-block">
				<p>
				<data-comment># input_from_user = "cool_user_1"</data-comment><br>
				sql_text = "select * from users where username like :input_from_user;"</br>
				sql_method(sql_text, input_from_user)<br>
				</p>
			</div>
			Now the example above is more like "suedocode", but the basic idea is that the user input and the rest of the statement is kept separate, and the database query uses a method that knows this. The method knows that the second argument is only to be interpreted as a matching pattern, and not as a command.</br></br> All the programmer  needs to worry about is sending the command off in this way, and the rest is done behind the scenes. 
			</p>
			
			<h4>NoSQL</h4>
			<p>
			More descriptively non-relational databases is a term given to data storage systems that don't follow the standard convention of having entries with fields and tables. Obviously It is possible to store data in another way, and any other way can be dubbed "NoSQL". The purpose of doing such a thing, usually is for performance optimization. This can be optimal when small performance gains are desired, over readability and ease of use. Usually big companies with huge server warehouses are concerned with these performance increases. After all they are paying for servers in terms of electricity. For small applications, the more organized, and easier to understand SQL relational databases are sufficient. </br></br> Regardless, the other classifications may include: </br>
			Keyâ€“value Stores</br>
			Column Store</br>
			Document Store</br>
			Graph Database</br></br>
			</p>
			
			<h4>General Optimization</h4>
			<p>
			Other ways to optimize a database include making normalizing and indexing:</br>
			</p>
			
			<h4>Normalization</h4>
			<p>
			Normalizing a database is basically all about not repeating data. This does two things: It help keep the database smaller, and it prevents against data conflicts. The practice of doing this involves a lot of linking. If a customer has an address, and they create an order. The order entry saved should include  a field for address_id, not the whole address just copied into this other table. You already have that data, so you should just link to it. Later when you need to pull up data that is normalized, it may take a lot of "join" commands. This is a drawback, but generally is considered worth it. Data conflicts can arise when you store the same data in two different places. Lets say eventually, somewhere in your app you add a feature to  change the address.  Its extremely difficult to remember that the address has now been stored in an address table entry, and in every order entry by that customer. when you don't save redundant information in your database, this is imposible to happen.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Indexing</h4>
			<p>
			When you create a field in an SQL database you can choose at any time for it to be an "index". Basically this makes it faster to search though when you are looking up entries using <data-code>WHEN that_field = "some_keyword"</data-code>. What the database does, is create a hash-table for that field. The database can find the entry using binary sort methods that are much faster than the usual method of looking through the database one entry at a time from start to finish. This can also have a negative affect if you are inserting entries into the database more often then searching. Every time you insert a new entry into the table, the hash-table has to be re-organized. Generally something like "user_id" should probably be an index because it is used to relate everything back to a user.

			<h2>Applying Social Science <data-date>April 23th, 2014</data-date></h2>
			<h3>The Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<p> A few weeks ago I wrote a blog entry detailing some of the values that I believe are at my core. Last week in class we learned about a phenomenon known as the stereotype threat. Now I'd like to take a look at ways to put the knowledge to use. The following are what I consider my strong suit: </p>
			<h3>My Core Values</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Truth</li>
				<li>Integrity</li>
				<li>Responsibility</li>
				<li>Freedom</li>
				<li>Environmentalism</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			<h4>Freedom:</h4> This can mean a lot of things, And I tend to use the liberal definition of it. I believe a person is free to do as they please, so long as it doesn't directly infringe on another person's freedoms. This means, that you are free to overcome, and free to move up in this world no matter where you are from. </br></br>  
			<h4>Integrity:</h4> This to me is all about being a good person on a consistent bases, independent of where or when, or who might be watching. Doing this makes a person feel good about their life. I think I'm a good person, because I good things for others when I can. Believing in myself should affect my own performance in a stressful situation where I might be tempted to give up.</br></br>
			<h4>Responsibility:</h4> I believe in evolution. I also believe that fun and happiness are feelings cause by evolution. When something "feels good" its probably because its affecting our evolution goals positively. Luckily this is a rewarding world view because evolution is a net positive game. It can be at least. The goal is the advancement and reproduction of oneself and the human race. Everyone can win together, and become happy. We do live here on a finite earth right now, and thats where the <b>environmentalism</b> comes in. But as Hans Rosling's research has shown, areas with high quality of life have family planing, and therefore actually have significantly smaller family sizes and slower population growth. I believe curbing overpopulation is an important part of protecting our planet for the foreseeable future.</br></br>
			<h4>Truth:</h4> Most of all I believe in truth. This is the most important of the virtues, because it means I believe in what's real. Like the stereotype threat. Simply knowing about the stereotype threat, and understanding it is by far the most awesomely effective way to overcome it. The fact is any that race or group is virtually as capable at a task as any other. Once you accept that, you should be able to avoid falling victim to it at least when its obvious.

			<h2>Functional vs. Imperative Programming <data-date>April 17th, 2014</data-date></h2>
			<p>
			One of the newest programming paradigms to be talked about is "functional programming". Depending on how strict you want to get with it, its a style that uses no variables, and no "states". It achieves tasks using only functions. Because functions only depend on input and output, and functional languages don't have states, the behavior of a program can be much more predictable. With other styles of programming, it can be virtually imposible to test every possible situation for unusual behavior. There are some languages that allow for this style, they must have "first class" functions. This means that functions can be passed as arguments just the way that variables usually are. Javascript and Ruby are two languages that do this. Languages Like "C" do not. Other languages are strictly functional. These languages dont even allow for conventional variables. One very popular strictly functional language is called Haskell. Many believe this style of programming may be the future of large software projects.</p>
			<h3>Uses</h3>			
			<p>Strictly functional languages right now are very talked about in academia, but are seldom used in business applications. I believe this is because they are harder to understand. I have read a lot about them and still don't really understood how to get around using variables. On the other hand. Languages with blocks and lambdas can use functional techniques when appropriate. Many of these languages are very popular and widely used.</p>
			<h3>Outlook</h3>			
			<p>Although they have many advantages, the fact of the matter is, the world will not begin to use strictly functional languages anytime soon. For the most part, companies don't have the budget to redo all of there code. Even new systems will most likely use a mix of both functional and imperative styles, because many of the differences with are both advantages and disadvantages. Sometimes functional implementations are more efficient; Sometimes less. Sometimes they are easier to code; Other times harder. Sometimes they are easier to read; Other times much more difficult. Whether or not a company decides to implement functional languages in the future depends on a number of things including how well the concepts happen to lend themselves to the specific application. Some uses of functional concepts are more straightforward, while others are not. One thing is for sure: There will be some transitioning in the near future toward many of these useful techniques</p>

			<h2>The Stereotype Threat <data-date>April 14th, 2014</data-date></h2>
			<p> Claude M. Steele is a Social Psychologist who has spent most of his career researching and experimenting with a phenomenon he calls the stereotype threat. He tries to understand social interactions in everyday life. He started his research wondering why ethnicities, and groups with negative academic stereotypes seem to actually underperform in schools. His goals include finding ways to integrate races more harmoniously in ways that everyone can flourish independent of race and negative stereotypes.</p>
			<h3>Background: What is it?</h3>
			<p> The stereotype threat is a phenomenon where stereotypes, especially negative ones, actually affect cognitive outcomes. Countless controlled experiments have confirmed this. Basically, if you remind someone of the negative stereotype before taking a test, they will perform significantly worse ( 0.6 standard deviations was a notable amplitude of this affect). The experiments themselves were quite convincing. Mixing around opposing stereotypes for asian women for instance, you can cause them to perform better or worse on a math test, depending on the stereotype you focus on. This work seems to prove its own significance. Obviously when someones identity affects their work, it becomes an important thing to consider. </p>
			<p>Steele suggested the reasons for people underperforming under the weight of a negative a stereotype may go like this: When the student gets to a tough  question, they begin fall back on the stereotype. As much as they want to disprove it, they become frustrated, and their mind begins to race. There is physical evidence documenting the persons nervous system becoming heightened as well.</p>
			<h3>My Experience with The Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<p>We all have personal identities, and the ones that affect us the most, are the ones that are brought to our attention most often in social situations. For instance I'm Italian. I'm proud of that, and I identify myself as such, but you can't tell by looking at me, and it doesn't really come up much. For me, this identity isn't affecting me too much in the ways relevant to this work. I also have never really heard of many limiting stereotypes attached to being Italian.</p>
			<p>Steele has done experiments where he told a white student he/she was going to have an open discussion about affirmative action. He showed the person pictures of who they would be talking to. In some cases the pictures were of black people, and in others, they were white people. The idea of having a conversation about race with black people, scared them. They would arrange the chairs in the room much further appart.  This is one thing I can relate to. Nobody wants to be perceived as racist, myself being a white male that considers himself not to be racist, can relate to their nervousness. A white male might have a "lot to lose" in that situation. It could affect my life negatively to be perceived as a racist, and therefore I sometimes try to avoid that type of confrontation altogether. </p>			
			<h3>My Plan: How to Break the Cycle</h3>
			<p>Recognizing these stereotypes and realizing they are only as true as you believe they are, can help immensely. Looking past them and working together can have a positive affect as well. Steele talked about his own experience in grad school with an advisor that took him under his wing, and treated him like anybody else. He believes that relationship had a huge positive impact on him. Race was an identity that did not affect their relationship, and the mentor confirmed regularly simply through his actions, that Steele had as much to contribute as anyone else. </p>
			<p>Steele discussed an experiment on how to give good feedback as well. In situation where race barriers exist is is especially difficult to have well accepted feedback. The results of some of his feedback studies were very surprising as well. The best way to give feedback, according to his research, may have little to do with stereotypes or race. Letting the person know that you believe in their ability to do this particular type of work is the most productive way to give feedback. Telling them you think the world of them "in general" did not help at all, in Steele's studies.

			<h2>Object Properties and Methods: When to use public and private settings  <data-date>April 10th, 2014</data-date></h2>
			<h3>Object Methods</h3>
			<h4>You can set them as private, or by default they will be public</h4>
			<p>First off, what does making a an class method private even do? Normally, a method defined in a class is available to any object instance of that class. If you make the method private, the instance object can only call the method from <em>within the class definition</em>.</p><p>In the following example, the print_board method is private. It is being called from this game_over function which is inside the class definition.</p> 
			
			<div class="code-block">
				class Battle_game</br>
				&nbsp&nbsp def game_over (outcome)</br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp puts "You #{outcome}.\n\n"</br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp print_board(@computer_board)</br>
				&nbsp&nbsp end</br></br>
				&nbsp&nbsp private</br>
				&nbsp&nbsp def print_board(the_board)</br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the_board.each_with_index{|x, i|</br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp x.each{|y| print y }</br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp }</br>
				&nbsp&nbsp end</br>
				end</br>
			</div>
			 <h4>When to use this?</h4><p>In the battleship game example, let say you are defining the class, but other programmers are defining different pieces of the game. You want to make a method that prints the board <data-code>print_board()</data-code> (showing where all the ships were), to display after someone wins the game. You dont want another programmer to accidentally use this in a way that reveals it during the game. You can define that method as private and only call it from the <data-code>game_over()</data-code> method. (a method only called when the game ends).</p>
			<p>You really might want to make most of the methods private, and only have a few public ones like <data-code>take_turn()</data-code> and <data-code>display_game_status()</data-code>. </p>
			
			
			<h3>Object properties: When to set them as readable/ writable, and when not to</h3>
			<p>As with methods, an object's properties have accessibility settings as well. Within a class definition creating object properties is as simple as defining them using an <data-code>@</data-code> symbol. For example <data-code>@num_misses_so_far</data-code>. In ruby, by default, you wont be able to examine or manipulate this property from outside the walls of your class definition. Analogous to having the "private" setting we just talked about. Only with properties, <em>they are private by default</em>. If you want to be able to read the property or write to it from the outside, you need to add an <data-code>attr</data-code> statement: </p> 
			<div class = "code-block"> 
			class Battle_game</br>
			&nbsp&nbsp attr_reader  :num_misses_so_far<data-comment> # property is publicly readable</data-comment></br>
			&nbsp&nbsp attr_writer  :num_misses_so_far<data-comment> #  is publicly writable</data-comment></br>
			&nbsp&nbsp attr_accessor  :num_misses_so_far<data-comment> # is publicly readable and writable</data-comment></br>
			end</br>
			</div>
			<p>In practice, you would only ever use one of the three statements above, depending on what kind of access you want.
			Now you can access this property from anywhere if you have a battle_game_instance: <data-code>battle_game_instance.num_misses_so_far</data-code>.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Class Properties</h3>
			<p>You can also store variables pertaining to the class itself. They are not specific to an individual instance, and they are often used to store class settings like how many guesses the Battle_game allows <data-code>@@allowed_guesses = 10</data-code>. These variables are always defined within the class using two <data-code>@</data-code> symbols in a row: <data-code>@@</data-code>. Again, by default, the variable cannot be seen outside of the class definition. To access this variable you must define within the class a "getter" (or "setter"): A method usually of the same name that simply returns the class variable (or sets it). An example of a possible class variable and its getter function for our game might be </p>
			<div class="code-block">
				class Battle_game</br>
				&nbsp&nbsp @@allowed_guesses = 10</br></br>
				&nbsp&nbsp def self.allowed_guesses</br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  @@allowed_guesses</br>
				&nbsp&nbsp end</br></br>	
				end</br>
			</div>
			<p>
			Accessing this now is done by calling the <data-code>allowed_guesses</data-code> method directly on the class itself (not an instance of it) like so: <data-code>Battle_game.allowed_guesses</data-code>. 
			</p>
			<h4>Ruby Conventions</h4>
			<p>There are other languages that just make all these variables and others public by default making development a lot more rapid. There are pros and cons to each way of doing things. Remembering all of this is a bit confusing, but I think it makes programs faster, and less breakable (2 qualities that can be very important when working with large teams, on immense projects). </p>
			
			<h3>My Battleship Game</h3>
			<p>In an effort to properly use these concepts of private vs public object variables and methods, I decided to make this "battleship like" game. I call it "battleship like" because starting with the game of battleship, I changed the following rules, to make my example program a bit simpler  
			</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Single-player game. you just make guesses against the computer</li>
			<li>Computer doesn't take any turns</li>
			<li>You win by sinking all the computer's ships in <=  10 turns</li>
			<li>All ships take up just 1 spot</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Take a look at the variables, and methods and try to understand why I gave them the privacy settings (or lack thereof) that I did.</p>
			<p>Here is a link to the working program on github: <a href ="https://github.com/zmitton/phase_0_unit_2/blob/master/week_5/battleship.rb">Battleship.rb</a></p>

			<h2>Problems Facing the tech industry <data-date>April 8th, 2014</data-date></h2>
			<p>Every time something new is invented, an older thing becomes obsolete. This can scare some people, and even convince them that the innovative new thing is the causing harm and must be stopped. This kind of thinking is routed in fallacies, but nevertheless it can steer government policies, shut down companies, and affect public opinions.
			</p>
			<p>Lets rewind a few years to when the economy really took a dive around 2009. The stock market was volatile, people were lossing jobs, and companies were going broke. People trying to grasp the issues found had different opinions on who and what was to blame. Some said it was greed, not much you can do about that; Others said it was corruption, which doesn't get you very far without proof; But one source that always becomes an easy target, is inovation, technology, and just downright new shit that people dont understand. 
			</p>
			<h4>First up were fancy new mortgage practices.</h4>
			<p>A somewhat more recent activity has been the re-selling and re-selling of mortgages, that get grouped, and divided up, and "hedged" with other assets before they were sold in some completely different form way down the line. People hadn't heard of this until now. It seemed complicated. Complicated things are black magic.
			</p>
			<h4>Next was "micro-trades"</h4>
			<p>It's difficult for some people to understand how stocks work, or why this would add value to society, but they basically "naturally fund things that are working". thats the main idea, It's not always true, but overall it has to be. People intimately involved in this trade, will notice patterns: The price of seasonal commodities dropping in certain months etc. Some patterns are more subtle than others, but every stock broker is looking for them, and doing what they can to make money off this by buying low and selling high. This "greed" has a beneficial price stabilizing effect because selling something will lower the price... So selling high will steady it. Intelligent people have used computers to help them calculate these trends that they have found, and since the trades themselves are happening onlint now, the entire process (decision to sale) can happen within the computers. this has sparked more and more high speed "micro-trades" where these computers buy and sell many times a minute based on reasons unknown by outsiders. The finger was pointed at them, and some serious talk ensued about making the practice illegal. The boundaries of legality would have been impossible to define (can a person still use a calculator before deciding?), and luckily they didn't.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Here, There, Everywhere</h4>
			<p>The airline industry blamed new deal sites. Small businesses blamed large ones, and newspapers and books blamed Amazon. The list goes on and on. new innovation comes in, status quo gets shaken up. The question is simply, whether we want to live in a world that's improving, or if we would like to "look in" our current quality of life. Because we can keep things the same. If we are willing to keep paying high prices for things, that never improve, we can, and thats what some people are fighting for. As people began to panic, they called for the government, the one entity with the power to basically do whatever they want, to get involved. There are of course, other powerful entities, that can affect change be it good or bad, but what sets the government appart as the biggest threat to inovation: The government is the only entity that can use force. I dont even mean physical necessarily. Other opinions can only choose not to support something, the government can shut you down. 
			</p>
			<h4>These people are right</h4>
			<p>The problem is, that these people are right. New tech <em>does</em> encroach on current businesses. Thats because jobs only exist, where work is on the fringe between being trainable for a person to do, but not easy enough to find a way to eliminate it. </p>
			<h4>Do we have a solution?</h4>
			<p>So you're convinced. All you're jobs are going away. They are only here now for a short period, and they will be gone before you know it. What the hell are we going to do when there are non left?
			</p>
			<h4>Party into the Future</h4>
			<p>The thing about change, is that once you get past the fear, and really accept it, you realize that the other side is better than where you started. Even though jobs are becoming obsolete, new jobs- better ones, are being created all the time. To prove this point, all you have to do is realize that, technology is not a new thing. In the 50's there used to be a job called a "computer" (no seriously). That was a person who was good at math, that sat down all day and calculated things that required lots and lots of mathematical computation. Someone used to have to do that. not just anyone, a smart person, who probably got paid pretty good. I'm glad to live in a world where I can get a job creating software and leave the long division behind. And it's not just since the 50's, this has been happening for literally thousands of years. Before the industrial revolution, 90% of people had to be farmers. 80% of them had to lose there job at some point. When work is eliminated, the world becomes richer, and everyone wins, even if a few people have a tough couple months movin' on.

			<h2>Enumerators <data-date>April 3rd, 2014</data-date></h2>
			<p>Some of the most useful functions in ruby are enumerators. They allow the programmer to loop through an array, hash, or numerical set, while and indicate a block of to perform on it. There are many of these enumerator functions, one of the easiest to understand is the <data-code>.map{|item| block }</data-code> function.</br></br>
			</p>
			<h3>map and map!</h3>
			<p>
			The map function performs the block once for each element in the group calling it. It creates a new array of all the returned values. If the "!" is indicated, the original array itself can be modified.</br></br>
			</p>
						<h3>Examples:</h3>
			<div class= "code-block">
			array1 = [1,2,3,4,5]</br>
			array2 = array1.map{|x|</br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  x*10</br>
			}</br>
			puts array1<data-comment>  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</data-comment></br>
			puts array2<data-comment>  # [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]</data-comment></br>
			</div>
			<p>In the above code the map function multiplies each element of array1 by 10 and outputs them as one new array which we assign to "array2". As you can see from the output array1 remains unchanged </br></br>
			If the exclamation point is used the original array can itself be modified instead:
			</p>
			<div class= "code-block">
			array1.map!{|x| <data-comment>  # notice the exclamation point this time</data-comment></br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  x*10</br>
			}</br>
			puts array1<data-comment>  # [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]</data-comment></br>
			</div>
			<p>
			This time the original array "array1" is modified, so there is usually no need for a second array to store the results</br></br>Although the results of this looping method may seem trivial I believe that's sort of the point. Doing this without using <data-code>.map{}</data-code> would take a few extra lines of code and would require a few temporary variables. Similar structures are made over and over by programers. Because of their simplicity, they tend to come up a lot. Having a built in method saves time for the coder, and the reader, while making the code smaller, slightly more efficient, and more elegant.

			<h2>Dealing with Conflict <data-date>April 2nd, 2014</data-date></h2>
			<h3>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h3>
			<p>I had a roommate who has been struggling with alcoholism. He has had a problem for years, but recently it really got out of control. I struggled with confronting him, and knowing what to do to help him stop. </p>
			<h3>What was the source of the conflict?</h3>
			<p>I cared about him, and the more I did to try to help him, the more angry he got at me. He would drink secretively, and when I was supposed to make sure he was sobering up, he kept wanting to leave the apartment by himself. He had many excuses as to why, and as soon as I solved them, he would manufacture another reason why a couldn't go with him.</p>
			<h3>How did you handle that conflict?</h3>
			<p> Eventually My friends and I realized he couldn't stop on his own. We got his parents envolved and they were able to get him to stop, although, is is still a struggle for him in general.</p>
			<h3>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h3>
			<p>Getting his parents involved definitely helped but I'm not sure anything else I did helped at all. The more intoxicated he was, the more difficult it became to appeal to him with logic.</p>
			<h3>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h3>
			<p>I would probably have called his parents or sponsor sooner if i had the chance again. Although we did call pretty quick (after about 1-2 weeks). I'll admit that nothing I did helped, so I would be open to trying other things.</p>
			<h3>What did you learn from this experience?</h3>
			<p>I learned that when you want to solve a problem that directly involves another person, you cant do it unless the other person has an interest in helping themselves. People can say that dealing with an intoxicated person isn't the same as a normal conflict, because they aren't mentally all there, but the real reason people do the things they do, is based more on emotions than anything. Emotions are actually based on real needs in a survival sense, so they can't (and shouldn't) be eliminated simply through a mental exercise. I usually try to understand why the emotion exists, and think about what actions to take to improve the area thats lacking. </p>

			<a name="looping"></a>
			<h2>Looping In Ruby <data-date>March 27th, 2014</data-date></h2>
			<p>Loops have always been one of the most important ideas that a computer can do. Loops, along with Sequences, and decisions make up the 3 structures that can create all programming logic. Having learned C++ first, the "while loop" was always the simplest. It's the easiest to understand: The block repeats <em>while</em> a condition is true. usually inside the loop a counter variable is incremented eventually stopping the code. Once you begin solving actual problems, it quickly becomes apparent that this "counter" variable come up over and over, which is when you learn the "for loop" basically the same as the while loop, except you define a temporary counter variable, and how to increment it concisely at the top. This makes the code faster and more readable.</br></br> With Ruby there seems to be a much different approach not just to looping, but to the language as a whole. There is an attitude toward simplifying and condensing code. This direction is emphasized by the number of different looping methods. Some of the ones that I have already been taught as a beginner are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>while</li>
				<li>for</li>
				<li>each</li>
				<li>each_with_index</li>
				<li>map</li>
				<li>collect</li>
				<li>inject</li>
				<li>sort_by</li>
				<li>delete_if</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This list can go on forever, and the documentation I have seen seems to have at least 30-40 methods like this.</br></br> The truth is, I'm not sure how I feel about this yet, because, although they can make your code more concise, they also cause the programmer to have to know what they do when they read them. It's nice to focus more on logic than syntax all of the time, but I'm already starting to see the over benefits of the more code.  </p>

				<h2>Pairing Sessions  <data-date>March 24th, 2014</data-date></h2>
				<p> So far in the first three weeks I've have done 2 guided pairing sessions and 2 regular ones. Its been an interesting and new expeirience for me. The first guided pairing session came at a good time durring the second week. I was starting to feel a little disconected from everyone, having never physically been in the smae room with any of them I was getting what can only be called technology overload. with all the new ways of communicating I was feeling lost. I missed the days when you could just physically meet with someone and they could help you with something; And I know pairing sessions use google hangout, which is technology as well, but at least you are "virtually" in a room with the person. Once the sessions begins, you are pretty much in the room with the person. I guess thats the best I can hope for fer now. </p>		
				<h3>Guided Pairing:</h3>
				<p>	The first session was a guided one. I couldn't have been happier with the outcome. My partner was 2 things:</br></br> Easy to work with</br>Knowledgable on the material.</br></br> Thats basically what you want. To be completely frank, and selfish: You want someone smarter than you on the other side. Thats the way you're gonna learn the most. All that aside, I did the best I could to keep up and contribute myself, And I think we played to each others strengths and weaknesses quite nicely. I informed him that css was not my dtrong suit beforehand, so we decided to have him drive on that part. I was able to drive durring the html part of the challenge, and we split the job down the middle. At the end we talked more about our personal lives and where we were each at. He was interested in working together again, so now I've got a cohort in the group that can help me out if I need it, and is willing to work in pairs going forward. The next guided session was similar. This time it was javascript that we were learning so I had a bit of lead on the other person. I probably taught the other person some stuff that time, and again, we discussed working together again because it went well.
				</p>			
				<h3>Pair-programming:</h3>
				<p>	Since the guided session I've arranged a few pairing sessions on my own. Most were with the same people I'd already met, and went just as smoothly as before. 1 however was with a new person and it went a bit awry. The problem was that neither of us really knew how to solve the problem. We started doing research durring the session, and it got rather quiet for a while. I',m sot sure what the best strategy is on that. I like to code little practice bits a piece at a time and view the output when testing new things I've never done before when coding. I didn't want to mess up our Stype but I dont really know how to do that kind of stuff as a pair. Maybe I will get better at it in time. We didn't end up finishing after an hour and we both had to go...

			<div id="feedback">
				<h2>Feedback</h2>
				<p> The feedback system we've mainly been using is a custom piece of software on Socrates where the feedback must be rated, before it can be administered. I'm not sure I've seen any of the benefits of that system yet because I've rated every piece I've seen as "kind". we don't know each other well enough yet to give each other really tough criticism. Maybe once we are all in a room together for 16 hours a day, we will start to give more passionate feedback.</br>/<br>Either way I'm not saying that I don't like the system of feedback. I think its a cool idea, and it remains to be seen how it will go later on.</p>

			<h2>Why is Javascript so Popular <data-date>March 20th, 2014</data-date></h2>
			<p>
				<h3>Don't let the name confuse you.</h3>
				<p>Javascript is not the same languages as Java. Javascript has almost no connection to Java at all. They have some similar syntax, but are very different types of languages, and work very differently. Java must be compiled before it can be used, while Javascript can be interpreted by a computer as-is because it is actually compiled live (just before it is executed). It actually used to be called "Livescript" for this reason. The suffix "script" can be misleading as well. Many times a language is considered "scripting" when it is specialized for just certain types of tasks. Javascript is actually a very powerful full language.</p>
				<h3>Javascript is the language of the World Wide Web.</h3>
				<p> 
					The internet is a big place with many different parts. Most people use a browser program to view web pages on the World Wide Web through there internet connection.</br>
					There are many other ways to communicate with this big connected network: For instance when you use an <em>app on your phone</em> that receives data. The connection is still needed for your phone to pull up the data, but this is not considered the "web", because you are not using a browser program.</br>
					Businesses often have <em>desktop applications</em> that use another type internet connection for their inventory systems. Inventory across multiple stores can be kept track of on one "cloud" server. That way each store has data that instantly reflects any changes that occur from any other stores.</br>
					As you can see, there are many different ways to comunicate with the internet but, by far, the most popular one is through a browser, on the web, and when it comes to browsers: <em>All major browsers use Javascript</em>. That means, that if a developer wants his website to work correctly for everybody, <em>they pretty much have to use javascript</em>.
				</p>
				<h3>Javascript is a Client Side Language</h3>
				<p>
					Many functions of a web page need to happen fast. The problem is: any action that requests data from the internet takes at least about a second. Thats usually not good enough. Enter Javascript. Javascript programs run on the user's (or client's) computer. When Javascript runs, it does not have to talk to the internet, it all can take place within the users computer, making it much much faster. When you click a button in javascript, it can take less than 1/1000 seconds: virtually instantaneously. Javascript is the reason everything you click within a web page isn't painstakingly slow.
				</p>				
				<h3>Javascript can do almost anything on a web page</h3>
				<p>
					In modern browsers the content of a site is loaded into javascript objects occurring to a convention called the DOM (document object module). Because of this, every single thing within a web page is available to javascript. Therefore developers can manipulate anything on the page, and write code in javascript to do that.

			<h3>The last time somebody asked my for advise</h3> 
			<p>The last time I can remember that somebody asked for my for advise, it was about talking to girls. I don't really know why he thought I would be able to help with that, I hardly knew the guy. He works at the community kitchen I volunteer at. I'm actually not much of a conversationalist myself but I obliged. I pretty much told him what I do when trying to converse with anyone I dont know very well: Ask questions. People like to talk about themselves. Also it takes the pressure off of you. Its much easier to be a good listener then to have to constantly think of something smart to say. I used to try to just act really cool, and say only witty things. The problem with that is: Its hard to constantly come up with awesomely smart things to say, and even if you do, it doesn't lend itself well to a two sided conversation. And when you ask questions, you can get to know the other person better. They might even be interesting!

			<h2>Favorite Sites <data-date>March 13th, 2014</data-date></h2>
			<h3>eBay</h3> <p> This has always been one of my favorite sites, its simple to understand and its always really easy to use. When you load the page, it forms perfectly to your current screen size no matter how big that may be. Right in fron, are tons of items I've viewed, or purchased in the past. You can continue to scroll down infinitely to see more and more of these elated items. This can seem a bit cluttered, but they are wnly pictures of other products, so the extra content does not add any confusion. As soon as you type in the name of what you are looking for, ebay switches to  search page, that has common items toward the top, and filters on the side for narrowing down the search. This really is where the page shines, because the internet is a huge place, and the functionality of being able to narrow down what you want in an affective way makes all the difference. The more time I spend on this site, the deeper I get into looking at products, and "chaining through links", from one to the next. I've bought tons of items on ebay, as well as sold some myself. Both actions support the company.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Wordpress</h3><p> This is a simple site, but I feel like the designers just have a really good eye when it comes to delivering content in an elegant way. The text is usually a bit bigger, and the fonts seem clean and new. The colors draw your eye in and make you think the site is a breeze to use. The site also has excellent fluid responsiveness. The homepage is basic, and minimal, with several break points, and no confusion as to your choices of what to do. I havent exactly "bought " anything from Wordpress, but I did use there website software to create a website once, and I ended up paying a sister company $80 for a template.
			</p>
					
			<p><h3>Amazon</h3> Amazon Is another website that has been around for a long time, and has updated its layout with the changing times of the internet. The attention on the page is drawn to the kindle and other items they are pushing, as well as a list of books that are chosen based on my user data. I've always found it easy to use, and I always feel like I'm able to find the best price on a particular book. This has to do with the way searches are done, laid out and organized, as well as the particular options you are given, and the way they store the books in their database. I've bought lots of books on this site, and sold some of my old textbooks as well. I'm the type of person that likes to read weird and rare books and before amazon, there was really no way to do that. Now there is a phenomenal way, and I can even buy used for cheaper than a bookstore.
