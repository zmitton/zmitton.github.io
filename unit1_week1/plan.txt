	The site will have the purpose Of linkin to and organizing all of the information that we need to keep track of for dev bootcamp. The site should be responsive and it should have images logos and menus. There will be a picture of me, and a basic profile at the top of the page. I will explain a bio and then have a nav menu, but for now the main page is all there will be. New content will basically go in line. The site will be mostly optimized for a small (mobile) screen. The page will have a section for explaining what I have learned thus far at DBC
