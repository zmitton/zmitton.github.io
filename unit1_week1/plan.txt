	The site will have the purpose Of linkin to and organizing all of the websites and services I am a member of. All of these type of links will open in their own page. There will also be a header menu that linkes to a few other minor pages within the site. The header will be included on all pages. The site should be responsive and will "break" at a certain view width. There will be a picture of me, and a basic profile at the top of the page. I will explain a bio, but for now the main page is all there will be. New content will basically go in-line. The site will be optimized for a small (mobile) screen. The page will have a section for explaining what I have learned thus far at DBC
