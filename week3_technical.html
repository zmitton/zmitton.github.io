			<p>Loops have always been one of the most important ideas that a computer can do. Loops, along with Sequences, and decisions make up the 3 structures that can create all programming logic.

<!--
Research one of the following questions/topics. In your blog post, you will want to explain the background and teach others how to implement what you've learned.

Arrays vs. Hashes. What are they? What are they good for? How do you know which one to use? (Teach others a strategy for deciding)
Looping - Discuss the various ways to loop in Ruby. How can you decide which is best to use? (Teach others a strategy for deciding)
Ruby vs. JavaScript - Discuss the benefits/drawbacks of each as you've experienced them. Explain to others how to decide which is better to use for what. Also include examples of how to do the same thing in each.
If you want to go more in-depth with any of these research memory use and link it to your strategy for deciding which to use.
