			<h2>My Bio</h2>
			<p>  Hi, my name is Zac Mitton and you have reached my webpage hosted on GitHub. My hobbies include Ceramics, and playing Ultimate (frisbee). Right now I am in the midst of a major life change. I just moved to lincoln park, and am beging at Dev Bootcamp in May (officially). Dev Bootcamp is like a very intense accelerated software development course aimed at preparing students to enter the tech industry. It's nine weeks long and occupies student's entire life durring that time. Im doing it because I want a better career and software/technology interest me more than anything. I like to build things, and I like new technologies, which is also why I'm a member of the local Chicago Hackerspace, PS1. </p>

			<h2>Dev Bootcamp</h2>
			<p>My experience so far at Dev Bootcamp has been pretty good. I have only started "Phase Zero" so far. That is what they call the initial prep work you are assigned to do from home, before the program really begins. </p> <h3>Week 1</h3> <p>The first week I was blown away at how much new material they through at us. I had a lot of trouble getting comfortable with all of the new accounts and web platforms we were required to set up and begin using. We absolutely <em>had</em> to figure them out, because we needed them to do everything from communicating with the instructors, to looking up assignments, to even turning our work in. I had quite a bit of trouble finding the time for all of this stuff and ended up not finishing a lot of the work on time that week</p>
			<h3>Week 2</h3><p> After a talk with one of the instructors, I was able to get back on track and begin catching up on assignments. Unfortunately because I was already behind, and more and more work was getting thrown at me, again I was up till midnight on  Sunday unable to finish the final assignments.</p>
			<h3>Week 3</h3><p> Finally now we are reaching the middle of week three and I feel like I will hopefully be able to get caught up. I am still working on a few things from the previous weeks, but I have a good understanding of what is left and I think I can manage fitting it in between my other jobs.</p>
