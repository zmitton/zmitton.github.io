			<h2>Why is Javascript so Popular</h2>
			<p>
				<h3>Don't let the name confuse you.</h3>
				<p>Javascript is not the same languages as Java. Javascript has almost no connection to Java at all. They have some similar syntax, but are very different types of languages, and work very differently. Java must be compiled before it can be used, while Javascript can be interpreted by a computer as-is because it is actually compiled live (just before it is executed). It actually used to be called "Livescript" for this reason. The suffix "script" can be misleading as well. Many times a language is considered "scripting" when it is specialized for just certain types of tasks. Javascript is actually a very powerful full language.</p>
				<h3>Javascript is the language of the World Wide Web.</h3>
				<p> 
					The internet is a big place with many different parts. Most people use a browser program to view web pages on the World Wide Web through there internet connection.</br>
					There are many other ways to communicate with this big connected network: For instance when you use an <em>app on your phone</em> that receives data. The connection is still needed for your phone to pull up the data, but this is not considered the "web", because you are not using a browser program.</br>
					Businesses often have <em>desktop applications</em> that use another type internet connection for their inventory systems. Inventory across multiple stores can be kept track of on one "cloud" server. That way each store has data that instantly reflects any changes that occur from any other stores.</br>
					As you can see, there are many different ways to comunicate with the internet but, by far, the most popular one is through a browser, on the web, and when it comes to browsers: <em>All major browsers use Javascript</em>. That means, that if a developer wants his website to work correctly for everybody, <em>they pretty much have to use javascript</em>.
				</p>
				<h3>Javascript is a Client Side Language</h3>
				<p>
					Many functions of a web page need to happen fast. The problem is: any action that requests data from the internet takes at least about a second. Thats usually not good enough. Enter Javascript. Javascript programs run on the user's (or client's) computer. When Javascript runs, it does not have to talk to the internet, it all can take place within the users computer, making it much much faster. When you click a button in javascript, it can take less than 1/1000 seconds: virtually instantaneously. Javascript is the reason everything you click within a web page isn't painstakingly slow.
				</p>				
				<h3>Javascript can do almost anything on a web page</h3>
				<p>
					In modern browsers the content of a site is loaded into javascript objects occurring to a convention called the DOM (document object module). Because of this, every single thing within a web page is available to javascript. Therefore developers can manipulate anything on the page, and write code in javascript to do that.
